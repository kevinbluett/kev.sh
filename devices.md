### Programmable BLE Devices
* [LightBlue Beans](https://punchthrough.com/bean/)
* [Coin](https://onlycoin.com/)
* [BLEmini](http://redbearlab.com/blemini/)

### Unreleased/Vaporware BLE Devices
* [Wearpoint](http://wearpoint.com/)
* 

### CPU
An exploration into the majority of the devices leaves us with two major 
* flexible, uses max-width for responsive goodness
* responsive drop down menu
* retina images using @2x
* post loop in the footer showing 3 latest post
* custom portfolio page for case studies

### Acknowledgements
I utilized my own HTML templates, but had no prior knowledge of liquid nor the required Jekyll system file format. I took [Michael Rose](http://twitter.com/mmistakes)'s theme [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Having a prebuilt archive and the YAML front-matter already set up was a great help. 

 The lovely font shown here is Calendas. For full splendor on your blog, I suggest you [head over and buy that](http://calendasplus.com/). The full family is 3 weights and costs $3. Many thanks to Daniel Bruce for the wonderful Entypo icons. Those can be picked up at [entypo.com](http://entypo.com), but are included with the source files. It's also <b>retina ready</b> via retina.js. Check out how that works over at [retinajs.com](http://retinajs.com).

### The Name
Balzac was a famous writer, known for his beautiful prose. I read some Balzac in school, but mostly feel comfort in the name of my favorite coffee shop in Stratford, Ontario.
