<p>I utilized my own HTML templates, but had no prior knowledge of liquid nor the required Jekyll system file format. I took <a href="http://twitter.com/mmistakes">Michael Rose</a>â€™s theme <a href="http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a>. Having a prebuilt archive and the YAML front-matter already set up was a great help.</p>

<p>The lovely font shown here is Calendas. For full splendor on your blog, I suggest you <a href="http://calendasplus.com/">head over and buy that</a>. The full family is 3 weights and costs $3. Many thanks to Daniel Bruce for the wonderful Entypo icons. Those can be picked up at <a href="http://entypo.com">entypo.com</a>, but are included with the source files. Itâ€™s also <b>retina ready</b> via retina.js. Check out how that works over at <a href="http://retinajs.com">retinajs.com</a>.</p>

<p>Balzac was a famous writer, known for his beautiful prose. I read some Balzac in school, but mostly feel comfort in the name of my favorite coffee shop in Stratford, Ontario.</p>
